### Code Architecture

`gedit` is built with a clean, modular architecture to make it easy for developers to understand and contribute. The logic is separated into distinct packages:

  * **`app`**: The main application orchestrator, containing the event loop.
  * **`editor`**: Defines the core `State` struct, which holds all the data about the editor's current state.
  * **`view`**: Handles all rendering and drawing logic to the terminal screen.
  * **`input`**: Manages all keyboard input and executes commands that modify the editor state.
  * **`file`**: Contains the logic for loading from and saving to the file system.
